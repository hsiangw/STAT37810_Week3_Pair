df
```

```{r}
library(tibble)
df<-df%>%add_row(name="Donald",age=74,city="NYC",favorite.color="red",height.cm.=190,weight.kg.=90)
df
```

6. 
```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```

7. It seems the engine has 4 cylinders.
```{r}
rnum<-which(rownames(mtcars)=="Datsun 710") #Row number of the Datsun 710
cnum<-which(colnames(mtcars)=="cyl") #Col number of the number of cylinders
mtcars[rnum,cnum] #It seems the engine has 4 cylinders

```


8. Repeating (7) using column names
```{r}
mtcars["Datsun 710","cyl"]
```

9. It seems the dataframe has 32 rows and 11 columns.
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
ncol(mtcars)
```


10. 
```{r}
mtcars[["mpg"]]
mtcars[[1]]
```

11.
```{r}
mtcars$mpg
```

12.
```{r}
mtcars[,"mpg"]
mtcars[,c("mpg","hp")]
```

13. The mean mpg is 20.09.
```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

14.
```{r}
plot(mtcars$hp,mtcars$mpg,main="hp vs. mpg",xlab="hp",ylab="mpg")
```

15. It seems mpg is significantly negatively associated with hp.
```{r}
summary(lm(mpg~hp,data=mtcars))
